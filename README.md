[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/irssi/irssi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/irssi/irssi)

Irssi is a modular chat client that is most commonly known for its
text mode user interface, but 80% of the code isn't text mode
specific. Irssi comes with IRC support built in, and there are
third party [ICB](https://github.com/jperkin/irssi-icb),
[SILC](http://www.silcnet.org/),
[XMPP](http://cybione.org/~irssi-xmpp/) (Jabber),
[PSYC](http://about.psyc.eu/Irssyc) and
[Quassel](https://github.com/phhusson/quassel-irssi) protocol modules
available.
