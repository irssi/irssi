- /IRCNET ADD/REMOVE
- mites se awaylogi? se /cattaamaan myös se /away:n jälkeen
- poista se common-setup.h
- quitissa se räpeltää ruutua liikaa..
- perli kaatui välillä ym. kivaa.

[21:48] < santo> [20:51] ¤¤¤ #twiggy,#tanum,#d2mac,#linux.nu,#sweden2k
Cannot join channel (illegal name)
.. /mode #a,#b voi sanoa myös jossain serverillä jotain outoa.. irc.carnet.hr

.. logit rehashissa sammuu, /window logit katoaa kokonaan? kai /window logit
   pelaa oikein jos ikkunan refnum vaihtuu?
.. joosella oli joku bufferibugi. bufferi pieneksi, pguppia, paljon tekstiä
lisää, alas, --more-- jää
.. /sb bugaa! /SB GOTO 23:59 tms. ei pelaa

- rikki:
   - dcc
   - gnome versio..
   - pluginit

- teemat (toimiiko ne edes?)
 - teeman vaihto tekstiversiolla, tekstien muuttaminen tekstiversiolla
 - teemoihin tee jotain pientä selitystä edes!
 - irssi can't find new themes in ~/.irssi/ while running - scan for new
   themes when opening themes dialog? irssi-text also needs to be restarted
   to use new themes..
 - use different themes in different channels/queries?
 - logi voisi käyttää omaa teemaa

- /set hold_mode, ja /CAT toimimaan sen kanssa jotenkin nerokkaasti..
- curses sijainti jotain rikkoo, ja openbsd:ssä on -lcurses, ei -lncurses

 - /msg =dcc_chatti,#kanava .. ei pelaa tollanen. voisi laittaa coreen tuon
   ja jotain hookkeja et eri chattiprotoille voisi vaikka mennä se teksti..
   ctcp:lle sama?
 - who ja listiin ne eri vipuset
- /ON

 - line-split.c: varmista että se 64k limitti toimii eikä esim. kaada!
- /exec
 - autorun.ircnet
 - channel not available rejoini

*** Bugs

 - %| doesn't work with irssi text widget
 - some problems when using multiple windows with focus being all the time in
   one of the windows and it can't be changed to different window?! Probably
   has something to do with click to focus.
 - split windows are buggy, destroying them doesn't really work well..
 - mirc ctcp togglemenuitem isn't updated right
 - multiple dcc connections from different irc networks from same nick
   doesn't work. Maybe create "server nick" and "refer nick" variables to
   DCC_REC?

*** text UI

 - statusbar:
     - you can't configure it in any way!
     - when starting to run out of space some items could be made smaller,
       activity for example .. make some generic flag for items to use.
     - "you have new mail"

*** Big things

 - session saving thing.. specify what channels/queries/dcc chats to open in
   which window (real/tabbed/in same window with some other), what irc net
   channels goes to where, what channels/queries to open at startup, etc.
   use dialog with gtktree widget to change it.
 - some sort of address book? our own irssi ctcp to ask for other irssi users
   for their information (of course not without asking (except optionally))..
   could be nice also to automatically update it, keep track of all seen
   users gathered when joining channels, whois, who, etc. commands.
   automatically updating information could be host masks, nicks, ips, seen in
   channels, operator in channels, .. user specified checks like last topic or
   mode changes or even msgs to you/some channel/with some keyword. great for
   spying people ;) maybe even useful sometimes..

   .. but what database would be best for this?

 - GTK version: icons to toolbars, accelerators to menus
 - Windows style MDI windows are possible with GtkFixed .. Some people would
   like this.. too much job for me, it would need building the MDI windows
   ourself (title bar, borders, resizing, etc.)

 - online help, documentation, ...
 - plugins:
     - scheme, tcl, python scripting? eggdrop/epic compatible scripting?
     - IRC bot, eggdrop is too old, needs a replacement ;) (started)
     - DCC file server, I'm not too excited about this, maybe someone else
       wants to do it..
     - Multiplayer games! :) Chess, tic-tac-toe, othello, battleship, tetris,
       etc. Existing games should probably be used .. though there doesn't
       seem to be any of these (except tetris) for gnome right now..
     - audio / video chat :)

*** Needs rethinking ..

 * Notify list GUI
 - _one_ popup dialog could open which lists all nicks in notifylist, maybe
   sorted by arrival time, display the dates, latest joined could be with
   different color? etc.
 - nick-specific options:
    - pop up the dialog
    - run some command (like /exec as soon as I get that done :)

 * common api for statusbar handling
 - it should work just as well in text mode and gui, colors could be done
   with the normal % formats. GUI just ignores the colors..
 - display number of ops, voices, normals and ircops in statusbar

 * API for creating/modifying menus and toolbar, especially from plugins
 - at least one configurable menu ("usermenu"), or maybe make the whole
   menubar user configurable


*** Little things

 - /savewindows - save the current channel/query positions to file and
   load them at startup.
 - multi-DCC - open multiple sockets to transfer the file
 - autoaway when idling
 - nickserv support (automatic /msg nickserv identify password)
 - /exec
 - itext:
     - save/find text
     - text selection draws the entire selection every time you move the
       mouse...
     - if some other window has got much text, switching to it first time
       takes some time..?
 - editor in setup for ~/.irssi/startup
 - gui help
 - change signal handling in gui-gnome so that the actual drawing and
   functionality are in different signals, so that plugin could change the
   whole look and feel of irssi.
 - currently irssi sends USERHOST commands every now and then to find out
   who are away and who are not.. optionally it could instead just watch if
   someone hasn't written anything to channel in n minutes and mark it "away"
   to nicklist.
 - check new irssi versions with http rather than with irssibot..
 - implement requesting files with DCC GET from remote client for dcc file
   servers. good for people behind firewalls.
 - gnome statubar:
    - clock?
    - dcc transfer meter (gtk progressbar)
 - you could configure which events (whois, notify, etc.) to show in what
   windows (all, current, status, msgs)
 - dcc send: allow selection of multiple files to send (also for dnd from
   gmc!) Allow dropping files to anywhere in irssi.
 - /timer, /clones
 - {}|~ are same as []\^ (not in all irc networks) - does this really affect
   irssi at all..?
