irssi (0.8.10~rc5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging to unify irssi-text and irssi-snapshot
  * Check for an executable file before we try to execute it with /upgrade
    (Closes: #242026)
  * Only allow /exec to recurse 100 times (Closes: #186416)
  * Call SIGTSTP rather than SIGSTOP on ^Z (With thanks to Mark Hymers
    <mark.hymers@ncl.ac.uk>) (Closes: #177108) 
  * Redirect Glib critical errors to the status window rather than to stderr
    (Closes: #270596)
  * Correctly lower case chat protocols using g_ascii_strdown() rather than
    using the deprecated g_strdown() (pushed upstream) (Closes: #232628)
