1. First steps

IRC Networks are made of servers, and servers have channels. The default config
has a few predefined networks, to list them:

/NETWORK LIST

And to connect to one of those networks and join a channel:

/CONNECT Freenode
/JOIN #irssi

To add more networks:

/NETWORK ADD ExampleNet

Then add some servers (with -auto to automatically connect):

/SERVER ADD -auto -network ExampleNet irc.example.net

Automatically join to channels after connected to server:

/CHANNEL ADD -auto #lounge ExampleNet

To modify existing networks (or servers, or channels) just ADD again using the
same name as before. This configures a network to identify with nickserv and
wait for 2 seconds before joining channels:

/NETWORK ADD -autosendcmd "/^msg nickserv ident pass;wait 2000" ExampleNet

If you have irssi 0.8.18 or higher and the irc network supports it, you can use
SASL instead of nickserv, which is more reliable:

/NETWORK ADD -sasl_username yourname -sasl_password yourpassword -sasl_mechanism PLAIN Freenode

These commands have many more options, see their help for details:

/HELP NETWORK
/HELP SERVER
/HELP CHANNEL
/HELP

If you want lines containing your nick to hilight:

/HILIGHT nick

Or, for irssi 0.8.18 or higher:

/SET hilight_nick_matches_everywhere ON

To get beeps on private messages or highlights:

/SET beep_msg_level MSGS HILIGHT DCCMSGS

No other irssi settings are needed (don’t enable bell_beeps), but there may be
settings to change in your terminal multiplexer (screen/tmux), your terminal,
or your desktop environment.

2. Basic user interface usage

Windows can be scrolled up/down with PgUp and PgDown keys. If they don’t work
for you, use Meta-p and Meta-n keys. For jumping to beginning or end of the
buffer, use /SB HOME and /SB END commands.

By default, irssi uses “hidden windows” for everything. Hidden windows are
created every time you /JOIN a channel or /QUERY someone. There’s several ways
you can change between these windows:

Meta-1, Meta-2, .. Meta-0 - Jump directly between windows 1-10
Meta-q .. Meta-o          - Jump directly between windows 11-19
/WINDOW <number>          - Jump to any window with specified number
Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N            - Jump to previous / next window

Clearly the easiest way is to use Meta-number keys. Meta usually means the ALT
key, but if that doesn’t work, you can use ESC.

Mac OS X users with ALT key issues might prefer using [2]iTerm2 instead of the
default terminal emulator.

Alt key as meta, for xterm/rxvt users

If you use xterm or rxvt, you may need to set a few X resources:

 XTerm*eightBitInput:   false
 XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true

With rxvt, you can also specify which key acts as Meta key. So if you want to
use ALT instead of Windows key for it, use:

 rxvt*modifier: alt

You could do this by changing the X key mappings:

 xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L"

And how exactly do you set these X resources? For Debian, there’s /etc/X11/
Xresources/xterm file where you can put them and it’s read automatically when X
starts. ~/.Xresources and ~/.Xdefaults files might also work. If you can’t get
anything else to work, just copy and paste those lines to ~/.Xresources and
directly call xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources in some xterm. The resources affect
only the new xterms you start, not existing ones.

Split windows and window items

Note: [3]this guide might be a better introduction to window splits

Irssi also supports split windows, they’ve had some problems in past but I
think they should work pretty well now :) Here’s some commands related to them:

/WINDOW NEW                    - Create new split window
/WINDOW NEW HIDE               - Create new hidden window
/WINDOW CLOSE                  - Close split or hidden window

/WINDOW HIDE [<number>|<name>] - Make the split window hidden window
/WINDOW SHOW <number>|<name>   - Make the hidden window a split window

/WINDOW SHRINK [<lines>]       - Shrink the split window
/WINDOW GROW [<lines>]         - Grow the split window
/WINDOW BALANCE                - Balance the sizes of all split windows

By default, irssi uses “sticky windowing” for split windows. This means that
windows created inside one split window cannot be moved to another split window
without some effort. For example you could have following window layout:

 Split window 1: win#1 - Status window, win#2 - Messages window
 Split window 2: win#3 - IRCnet/#channel1, win#4 - IRCnet/#channel2
 Split window 3: win#5 - efnet/#channel1, win#6 - efnet/#channel2

When you are in win#1 and press ALT-6, irssi jumps to split window #3 and moves
the efnet/#channel2 the active window.

With non-sticky windowing the windows don’t have any relationship with split
windows, pressing ALT-6 in win#1 moves win#6 to split window 1 and sets it
active, except if win#6 was already visible in some other split window irssi
just changes to that split window. This it the way windows work with ircii, if
you prefer it you can set it with

/SET autostick_split_windows OFF

Each window can have multiple channels, queries and other “window items” inside
them. If you don’t like windows at all, you disable automatic creating of them
with

/SET autocreate_windows OFF

And if you keep all channels in one window, you most probably want the channel
name printed in each line:

/SET print_active_channel ON

If you want to group only some channels or queries in one window, use

/JOIN -window #channel
/QUERY -window nick

3. Server and channel automation

Irssi’s multiple IRC network support is IMHO very good - at least compared to
other clients :) Even if you’re only in one IRC network you should group all
your servers to be in the same IRC network as this helps with reconnecting if
your primary server breaks and is probably useful in some other ways too :) For
information how to actually use irssi correctly with multiple servers see the
chapter 6.

First you need to have your IRC network set, use /NETWORK command to see if
it’s already there. If it isn’t, use /NETWORK ADD yournetwork. If you want to
execute some commands automatically when you’re connected to some network, use
-autosendcmd option. Here’s some examples:

/NETWORK ADD -autosendcmd '^msg bot invite' IRCnet
/NETWORK ADD -autosendcmd "/^msg nickserv ident pass;wait 2000" OFTC

After that you need to add your servers. For example:

/SERVER ADD -auto -network IRCnet irc.kpnqwest.fi 6667
/SERVER ADD -auto -network worknet irc.mycompany.com 6667 password

The -auto option specifies that this server is automatically connected at
startup. You don’t need to make more than one server with -auto option to one
IRC network, other servers are automatically connected in same network if the
-auto server fails.

And finally channels:

/CHANNEL ADD -auto -bots *!*user@host -botcmd "/^msg $0 op pass" #irssi efnet
/CHANNEL ADD -auto #secret IRCnet password

-bots and -botcmd should be the only ones needing a bit of explaining. They’re
used to send commands automatically to bot when channel is joined, usually to
get ops automatically. You can specify multiple bot masks with -bots option
separated with spaces (and remember to quote the string then). The $0 in
-botcmd specifies the first found bot in the list. If you don’t need the bot
masks (ie. the bot is always with the same nick, like chanserv) you can give
only the -botcmd option and the command is always sent.

4. Setting up windows and automatically restoring them at startup

First connect to all the servers, join the channels and create the queries you
want. If you want to move the windows or channels around use commands:

/WINDOW MOVE LEFT/RIGHT/number    - move window elsewhere
/WINDOW ITEM MOVE <number>|<name> - move channel/query to another window

When everything looks the way you like, use /LAYOUT SAVE command (and /SAVE, if
you don’t have autosaving enabled) and when you start irssi next time, irssi
remembers the positions of the channels, queries and everything. This
“remembering” doesn’t mean that simply using /LAYOUT SAVE would automatically
make irssi reconnect to all servers and join all channels, you’ll need the /
SERVER ADD -auto and /CHANNEL ADD -auto commands to do that.

If you want to change the layout, you just rearrange the layout like you want
it and use /LAYOUT SAVE again. If you want to remove the layout for some
reason, use /LAYOUT RESET.

5. Status and msgs windows & message levels

By default, all the “extra messages” go to status window. This means pretty
much all messages that don’t clearly belong to some channel or query. Some
people like it, some don’t. If you want to remove it, use

/SET use_status_window OFF

This doesn’t have any effect until you restart irssi. If you want to remove it
immediately, just /WINDOW CLOSE it.

Another common window is “messages window”, where all private messages go. By
default it’s disabled and query windows are created instead. To make all
private messages go to msgs window, say:

/SET use_msgs_window ON
/SET autocreate_query_level DCCMSGS  (or if you don't want queries to
                                      dcc chats either, say NONE)

use_msgs_window either doesn’t have any effect until restarting irssi. To
create it immediately say:

/WINDOW NEW HIDE     - create the window
/WINDOW NAME (msgs)  - name it to "(msgs)"
/WINDOW LEVEL MSGS   - make all private messages go to this window
/WINDOW MOVE 1       - move it to first window

Note that neither use_msgs_window nor use_status_window have any effect at all
if /LAYOUT SAVE has been used.

This brings us to message levels.. What are they? All messages that irssi
prints have one or more “message levels”. Most common are PUBLIC for public
messages in channels, MSGS for private messages and CRAP for all sorts of
messages with no real classification. You can get a whole list of levels with

/HELP levels

Status window has message level ALL -MSGS, meaning that all messages, except
private messages, without more specific place go to status window. The -MSGS is
there so it doesn’t conflict with messages window.

6. How support for multiple servers works in irssi

ircii and several other clients support multiple servers by placing the
connection into some window. IRSSI DOES NOT. There is no required relationship
between window and server. You can connect to 10 servers and manage them all in
just one window, or join channel in each one of them to one single window if
you really want to. That being said, here’s how you do connect to new server
without closing the old connection:

/CONNECT irc.server.org

Instead of the /SERVER which disconnects the existing connection. To see list
of all active connections, use /SERVER without any parameters. You should see a
list of something like:

 -!- IRCNet: irc.song.fi:6667 (IRCNet)
 -!- OFTC: irc.oftc.net:6667 (OFTC)
 -!- RECON-1: 192.168.0.1:6667 () (02:59 left before reconnecting)

Here you see that we’re connected to IRCNet and OFTC networks. The IRCNet at
the beginning is called the “server tag” while the (IRCnet) at the end shows
the IRC network. Server tag specifies unique tag to refer to the server,
usually it’s the same as the IRC network. When the IRC network isn’t known it’s
some part of the server name. When there’s multiple connections to same IRC
network or server, irssi adds a number after the tag so there could be network,
network2, network3 etc.

Server tags beginning with RECON- mean server reconnections. Above we see that
connection to server at 192.168.0.1 wasn’t successful and irssi will try to
connect it again in 3 minutes.

To disconnect one of the servers, or to stop irssi from reconnecting, use

/DISCONNECT network   - disconnect server with tag "network"
/DISCONNECT recon-1  - stop trying to reconnect to RECON-1 server
/RMRECONNS           - stop all server reconnections

/RECONNECT recon-1   - immediately try reconnecting back to RECON-1
/RECONNECT ALL       - immediately try reconnecting back to all
                       servers in reconnection queue

Now that you’re connected to all your servers, you’ll have to know how to
specify which one of them you want to use. One way is to have an empty window,
like status or msgs window. In it, you can specify which server to set active
with

/WINDOW SERVER tag    - set server "tag" active
Ctrl-X                - set the next server in list active

When the server is active, you can use it normally. When there’s multiple
connected servers, irssi adds [servertag] prefix to all messages in non-channel
/query messages so you’ll know where it came from.

Several commands also accept -servertag option to specify which server it
should use:

/MSG -tag nick message
/JOIN -tag #channel
/QUERY -tag nick

/MSG tab completion also automatically adds the -tag option when nick isn’t in
active server.

Window’s server can be made sticky. When sticky, it will never automatically
change to anything else, and if server gets disconnected, the window won’t have
any active server. When the server gets connected again, it is automatically
set active in the window. To set the window’s server sticky use

/WINDOW SERVER -sticky tag

This is useful if you wish to have multiple status or msgs windows, one for
each server. Here’s how to do them (repeat for each server)

/WINDOW NEW HIDE
/WINDOW NAME (status)
/WINDOW LEVEL ALL -MSGS
/WINDOW SERVER -sticky network

/WINDOW NEW HIDE
/WINDOW NAME (msgs)
/WINDOW LEVEL MSGS
/WINDOW SERVER -sticky network

7. /LASTLOG and jumping around in scrollback

/LASTLOG command can be used for searching texts in scrollback buffer. Simplest
usages are

/LASTLOG word     - print all lines with "word" in them
/LASTLOG word 10  - print last 10 occurances of "word"
/LASTLOG -topics  - print all topic changes

If there’s more than 1000 lines to be printed, irssi thinks that you probably
made some mistake and won’t print them without -force option. If you want to
save the full lastlog to file, use

/LASTLOG -file ~/irc.log

With -file option you don’t need -force even if there’s more than 1000 lines. /
LASTLOG has a lot of other options too, see /HELP lastlog for details.

Once you’ve found the lines you were interested in, you might want to check the
discussion around them. Irssi has /SCROLLBACK (or alias /SB) command for
jumping around in scrollback buffer. Since /LASTLOG prints the timestamp when
the message was originally printed, you can use /SB GOTO hh:mm to jump directly
there. To get back to the bottom of scrollback, use /SB END command.

8. Logging

Irssi can automatically log important messages when you’re set away (/AWAY
reason). When you set yourself unaway (/AWAY), the new messages in away log are
printed to screen. You can configure it with:

/SET awaylog_level MSGS HILIGHT     - Specifies what messages to log
/SET awaylog_file ~/.irssi/away.log - Specifies the file to use

Easiest way to start logging with Irssi is to use autologging. With it Irssi
logs all channels and private messages to specified directory. You can turn it
on with

/SET autolog ON

By default it logs pretty much everything execept CTCPS or CRAP (/WHOIS
requests, etc). You can specify the logging level yourself with

/SET autolog_level ALL -CRAP -CLIENTCRAP -CTCPS (this is the default)

By default irssi logs to ~/irclogs/<servertag>/<target>.log. You can change
this with

/SET autolog_path ~/irclogs/$tag/$0.log (this is the default)

The path is automatically created if it doesn’t exist. $0 specifies the target
(channel/nick). You can make irssi automatically rotate the logs by adding date
/time formats to the file name. The formats are in “man strftime” format. For
example

/SET autolog_path ~/irclogs/%Y/$tag/$0.%m-%d.log

For logging only some specific channels or nicks, see /HELP log

9. Changing keyboard bindings

You can change any keyboard binding that terminal lets irssi know about. It
doesn’t let irssi know everything, so for example shift-backspace can’t be
bound unless you modify xterm resources somehow.

/HELP bind tells pretty much everything there is to know about keyboard
bindings. However, there’s the problem of how to bind some non-standard keys.
They might differ a bit with each terminal, so you’ll need to find out what
exactly the keypress produces. Easiest way to check that would be to see what
it prints in cat. Here’s an example for pressing F1 key:

 [user@host] ~% cat
 ^[OP

So in irssi you would use /BIND ^[OP /ECHO F1 pressed. If you use multiple
terminals which have different bindings for the key, it would be better to use
eg.:

/BIND ^[OP key F1
/BIND ^[11~ key F1
/BIND F1 /ECHO F1 pressed.

10. Proxies and IRC bouncers

Irssi supports connecting to IRC servers via a proxy. All server connections
are then made through it, and if you’ve set up everything properly, you don’t
need to do any /QUOTE SERVER commands manually.

Here’s an example: You have your bouncer (lets say, BNC or BNC-like) listening
in irc.bouncer.org port 5000. You want to use it to connect to servers
irc.dal.net and irc.efnet.org. First you’d need to setup the bouncer:

/SET use_proxy ON
/SET proxy_address irc.bouncer.org
/SET proxy_port 5000

/SET proxy_password YOUR_BNC_PASSWORD_HERE
/SET -clear proxy_string
/SET proxy_string_after conn %s %d

Then you’ll need to add the server connections. These are done exactly as if
you’d want to connect directly to them. Nothing special about them:

/SERVER ADD -auto -network dalnet irc.dal.net
/SERVER ADD -auto -network efnet irc.efnet.org

With the proxy /SETs however, irssi now connects to those servers through your
BNC. All server connections are made through them so you can just forget that
your bouncer even exists.

If you don’t want to use the proxy for some reason, there’s -noproxy option
which you can give to /SERVER and /SERVER ADD commands.

Proxy specific settings:

All proxies except irssi proxy and socks proxy have these settings in common:

/SET use_proxy ON
/SET proxy_address <Proxy host address>
/SET proxy_port <Proxy port>

HTTP proxy

Use these settings with HTTP proxies:

/SET -clear proxy_password
/EVAL SET proxy_string CONNECT %s:%d HTTP/1.0\n\n

BNC

/SET proxy_password your_pass
/SET -clear proxy_string
/SET proxy_string_after conn %s %d

dircproxy

dircproxy separates the server connections by passwords. So, if you for example
have network connection with password ircpass and OFTC connection with
oftcpass, you would do something like this:

/SET -clear proxy_password
/SET -clear proxy_string

/SERVER ADD -auto -network IRCnet fake.network 6667 ircpass
/SERVER ADD -auto -network OFTC fake.oftc 6667 oftcpass

The server name and port you give isn’t used anywhere, so you can put anything
you want in there.

psyBNC

psyBNC has internal support for multiple servers. However, it could be a bit
annoying to use, and some people just use different users for connecting to
different servers. You can manage this in a bit same way as with dircproxy, by
creating fake connections:

/SET -clear proxy_password
/SET -clear proxy_string

/NETWORK ADD -user networkuser IRCnet
/SERVER ADD -auto -network IRCnet fake.network 6667 ircpass
/NETWORK ADD -user oftcuser OFTC
/SERVER ADD -auto -network OFTC fake.oftc 6667 oftcpass

So, you’ll specify the usernames with /NETWORK ADD command, and the user’s
password with /SERVER ADD.

Irssi proxy

Irssi contains it’s own proxy which you can build giving \--with-proxy option
to configure. You’ll still need to run irssi in a screen to use it though.

Irssi proxy is a bit different than most proxies, normally proxies create a new
connection to IRC server when a new client connects to it, but irssi proxy
shares your existing IRC connection(s) to multiple clients. And even more
clearly: You can use only one IRC server connection of the irssi proxy to IRC
with as many clients as you want. Can anyone figure out even more easier ways
to say this, so I wouldn’t need to try to explain this thing for minutes every
time? :)

Irssi proxy supports sharing multiple server connections in different ports,
like you can share network in port 2777 and efnet in port 2778.

Usage in proxy side:

/LOAD proxy
/SET irssiproxy_password <password>
/SET irssiproxy_ports <network>=<port> ... (eg. IRCnet=2777 efnet=2778)

NOTE: you MUST add all the servers you are using to server and network lists
with /SERVER ADD and /NETWORK ADD. ..Except if you really don’t want to for
some reason, and you only use one server connection, you may simply set:

/SET irssiproxy_ports *=2777

Usage in client side:

Just connect to the irssi proxy like it is a normal server with password
specified in /SET irssiproxy_password. For example:

/SERVER ADD -network IRCnet my.irssi-proxy.org 2777 secret
/SERVER ADD -network efnet my.irssi-proxy.org 2778 secret

Irssi proxy works fine with other IRC clients as well.

SOCKS

Irssi can be compiled with socks support (\--with-socks option to configure),
which requires “dante” and routes all connections through the proxy specified
in the system-wide /etc/socks.conf. This method is known to have issues in Mac
OS X.

Note that /SET proxy settings don’t have anything to do with socks.

Using [4]proxychains-ng is recommended over recompiling irssi.

Others

IRC bouncers usually work like IRC servers, and want a password. You can give
it with:

/SET proxy_password <password>

Irssi’s defaults for connect strings are

/SET proxy_string CONNECT %s %d
/SET proxy_string_after

The proxy_string is sent before NICK/USER commands, the proxy_string_after is
sent after them. %s and %d can be used with both of them.

11. Irssi’s settings

Here’s some settings you might want to change (the default value is shown):
Also check the [5]Settings Documentation

Queries

/SET autocreate_own_query ON
    Should new query window be created when you send message to someone (with /
    MSG).
/SET autocreate_query_level MSGS
    New query window should be created when receiving messages with this level.
    MSGS, DCCMSGS and NOTICES levels work currently. You can disable this with
    /SET -clear autocreate_query_level.
/SET autoclose_query 0
    Query windows can be automatically closed after certain time of inactivity.
    Queries with unread messages aren’t closed and active window is neither
    never closed. The value is given in seconds.

Windows

/SET use_msgs_window OFF
    Create messages window at startup. All private messages go to this window.
    This only makes sense if you’ve disabled automatic query windows. Message
    window can also be created manually with /WINDOW LEVEL MSGS, /WINDOW NAME
    (msgs).
/SET use_status_window ON
    Create status window at startup. All messages that don’t really have better
    place go here, like all /WHOIS replies etc. Status window can also be
    created manually with /WINDOW LEVEL ALL -MSGS, /WINDOW NAME (status).
/SET autocreate_windows ON
    Should we create new windows for new window items or just place everything
    in one window
/SET autoclose_windows ON
    Should window be automatically closed when the last item in them is removed
    (ie. /PART, /UNQUERY).
/SET reuse_unused_windows OFF
    When finding where to place new window item (channel, query) Irssi first
    tries to use already existing empty windows. If this is set ON, new window
    will always be created for all window items. This setting is ignored if
    autoclose_windows is set ON.
/SET window_auto_change OFF
    Should Irssi automatically change to automatically created windows -
    usually queries when someone sends you a message. To prevent accidentally
    sending text meant to some other channel/nick, Irssi clears the input
    buffer when changing the window. The text is still in scrollback buffer,
    you can get it back with pressing arrow up key.
/SET print_active_channel OFF
    When you keep more than one channel in same window, Irssi prints the
    messages coming to active channel as <nick> text and other channels as
    <nick:channel> text. If this setting is set ON, the messages to active
    channels are also printed in the latter way.
/SET window_history OFF
    Should command history be kept separate for each window.

User information

/SET nick
    Your nick name
/SET alternate_nick
    Your alternate nick.
/SET user_name
    Your username, if you have ident enabled this doesn’t affect anything
/SET real_name
    Your real name.

Server information

/SET skip_motd OFF
    Should we hide server’s MOTD (Message Of The Day).
/SET server_reconnect_time 300
    Seconds to wait before connecting to same server again. Don’t set this too
    low since it usually doesn’t help at all - if the host is down, the few
    extra minutes of waiting won’t hurt much.
/SET lag_max_before_disconnect 300
    Maximum server lag in seconds before disconnecting and trying to reconnect.
    This happens mostly only when network breaks between you and IRC server.

Appearance

/SET timestamps ON
    Show timestamps before each message.
/SET hide_text_style OFF
    Hide all bolds, underlines, MIRC colors, etc.
/SET show_nickmode ON
    Show the nick’s mode before nick in channels, ie. ops have <@nick>, voices
    <+nick> and others < nick>
/SET show_nickmode_empty ON
    If the nick doesn’t have a mode, use one space. ie. ON: < nick>, OFF:
    <nick>
/SET show_quit_once OFF
    Show quit message only once in some of the channel windows the nick was in
    instead of in all windows.
/SET lag_min_show 100
    Show the server lag in status bar if it’s bigger than this, the unit is 1/
    100 of seconds (ie. the default value of 100 = 1 second).
/SET indent 10
    When lines are longer than screen width they have to be split to multiple
    lines. This specifies how much space to put at the beginning of the line
    before the text begins. This can be overridden in text formats with %|
    format.
/SET activity_hide_targets
    If you don’t want to see window activity in some certain channels or
    queries, list them here. For example #boringchannel =bot1 =bot2. If any
    highlighted text or message for you appears in that window, this setting is
    ignored and the activity is shown.

Nick completion

/SET completion_auto OFF
    Automatically complete the nick if line begins with start of nick and the
    completion character. Learn to use the tab-completion instead, it’s a lot
    better ;)
/SET completion_char :
    Completion character to use.

For all the ircII people

I don’t like automatic query windows, I don’t like status window, I do like
msgs window where all messages go:

/SET autocreate_own_query OFF
/SET autocreate_query_level DCCMSGS
/SET use_status_window OFF
/SET use_msgs_window ON

Disable automatic window closing when /PARTing channel or /UNQUERYing query:

/SET autoclose_windows OFF
/SET reuse_unused_windows ON

Here’s the settings that make irssi work exactly like ircII in window
management (send me a note if you can think of more):

/SET autocreate_own_query OFF
/SET autocreate_query_level NONE
/SET use_status_window OFF
/SET use_msgs_window OFF
/SET reuse_unused_windows ON
/SET windows_auto_renumber OFF

/SET autostick_split_windows OFF
/SET autoclose_windows OFF
/SET print_active_channel ON

12. Statusbar

/STATUSBAR displays a list of the current statusbars, along with their position
and visibility:

 Name                           Type   Placement Position Visible
 window                         window bottom    0        always
 window_inact                   window bottom    1        inactive
 prompt                         root   bottom    100      always
 topic                          root   top       1        always

/STATUSBAR <name> prints the statusbar settings (type, placement, position,
visibility) as well as its items. /STATUSBAR <name> ENABLE|DISABLE enables/
disables the statusbar. /STATUSBAR <name> RESET resets the statusbar to its
default settings, or if the statusbar was created by you, it will be removed.

The statusbar type can be either window or root. If the type is window, then a
statusbar will be created for each split window, otherwise it will be created
only once. Placement can be top or bottom, which refers to the top or bottom of
the screen. Position is a number, the higher the value the lower it will appear
in-screen. Visible can be always, active or inactive. Active/inactive is useful
only with split windows; one split window is active and the rest are inactive.
To adjust these settings, the following commands are available:

/STATUSBAR <name> TYPE window|root
/STATUSBAR <name> PLACEMENT top|bottom
/STATUSBAR <name> POSITION <num>
/STATUSBAR <name> VISIBLE always|active|inactive

Statusbar items can also be added or removed via command. Note that when
loading new statusbar scripts that add items, you will need to specify where
you want to show the item and how it is aligned. This can be accomplished using
the below commands:

/STATUSBAR <name> ADD [-before | -after <item>] [-priority #] [-alignment left|right] <item>
/STATUSBAR <name> REMOVE <item>

For statusbar scripts, the item name is usually equivalent to the script name.
The documentation of the script ought to tell you if this is not the case. For
example, to add mail.pl before the window activity item, use: /STATUSBAR window
ADD -before act mail.
