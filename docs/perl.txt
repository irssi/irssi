 Installation problems
 ---------------------

You'll need to have perl support compiled with irssi. If "/LOAD"
doesn't show perl in list of loaded modules, you have a problem. See
INSTALL file for information about perl problems.


 Running scripts
 ---------------

Scripts are run with /SCRIPT LOAD command, or the default /RUN alias.
"/SCRIPT" shows list of running script, and /SCRIPT UNLOAD can unload
scripts.

Scripts should be placed to ~/.irssi/scripts/ or
/usr/local/lib/irssi/scripts/ (or depending on where irssi was
installed) directories. After that /RUN script_name should work, you
don't need to add the .pl suffix.


 Irssi's signals
 ---------------

Irssi is pretty much based on sending and handling different signals.
Like when you receive a message from server, say

  :nick!user@there.org PRIVMSG you :blahblah

Irssi will first send a signal:

  "server incoming", SERVER_REC, "nick!user@there PRIVMSG ..."

You probably don't want to use this signal. Default handler for this
signal interprets the header and sends a signal:

  "server event", SERVER_REC, "PRIVMSG ...", "nick", "user@there.org"

You probably don't want to use this either, since this signal's default
handler parses the event string and sends a signal:

  "event privmsg", SERVER_REC, "you :blahblah", "nick", "user@there.org"

You can at any point grab the signal, do whatever you want to do with
it and optionally stop it from going any further by calling
Irssi::signal_stop();

For example:

  sub event_privmsg {
    # $data = "nick/#channel :text"
    my ($server, $data, $nick, $address) = @_;
    my ($target, $text) = split(/ :/, $data, 2);

    Irssi::signal_stop() if ($text =~ /free.*porn/ || $nick =~ /idiot/);
  }

Irssi::signal_add("event privmsg", "event_privmsg")

This will hide all public or private messages that match the regexp
"free.*porn" or the sender's nick contain the word "idiot". Yes, you
could use /IGNORE instead for both of these :)

You can also use signal_add_last() if you wish to let the Irssi's internal
functions be run before yours.

A list of signals that irssi sends can be found from signals.txt file.


 Creating/replacing /COMMANDS
 ----------------------------

You can create your own commands, or replace existing ones with
Irssi::command_bind(). The command handling work internally pretty much
the same as signal handlers, so if you replace existing command and don't
wish to let it run, call Irssi::signal_stop().

Here's an example:

  # Usage: /HELLO [<nick>]
  sub cmd_hello {
    # data - contains the parameters for /HELLO
    # server - the active server in window
    # witem - the active window item (eg. channel, query)
    #         or undef if the window is empty
    my ($data, $server, $witem) = @_;

    if (!$server || !$server->{connected}) {
      Irssi::print("Not connected to server");
      return;
    }

    if ($data) {
      $server->command("MSG $data Hello!");
    } elsif ($witem && ($witem->{type} eq "CHANNEL" ||
                        $witem->{type} eq "QUERY")) {
      # there's query/channel active in window
      $witem->command("MSG ".$witem->{name}." Hello!");
    } else {
      Irssi::print("Nick not given, and no active channel/query in window");
    }
  }

  Irssi::command_bind('hello', 'cmd_hello');


 Message levels
 --------------

Several functions expect message levels. They're used to roughly
classify messages. They're used by a lot of things including logging,
ignoring, highlighting, etc. so you should use as good level as
possible. It's possible to have several levels in one message, like
ACTIONS+PUBLIC or ACTIONS+MSGS.

Here's all the levels that irssi supports currently:

  CRAP, MSGS, PUBLIC, NOTICES, SNOTES, CTCPS, ACTIONS, JOINS, PARTS
  QUITS, KICKS, MODES, TOPICS, WALLOPS, INVITES, NICKS, DCC, DCCMSGS,
  CLIENTNOTICE, CLIENTCRAP, CLIENTERROR

And a few special ones that could be included with the levels above:

  HILIGHT - text is highlighted
  NOHILIGHT - don't check highlighting for this message
  NO_ACT - don't trigger channel activity when printing this message
  NEVER - never ignore or log this message (not a good idea usually)

You can use them with a MSGLEVEL_ prefix, for example:

  $server->print("#channel", 'Hello, world', MSGLEVEL_CLIENTCRAP);

Writes text to #channel window with CLIENTCRAP level.


 Window items
 ------------

Meaning of "window" should be pretty clear, but "window item" is
something I couldn't really figure out a better name for :) They're
simply something that's inside a window, a channel or a query usually.
Windows can have multiple items inside them. It's possible to create
non-channel/query window items too, currently the third possible window
item is created by /EXEC -interactive.

In scripts, I think you can quite safely assume that the window item is
query or channel if the script is intended to be run in one of them.
Stupid users won't probably have other window items, and smart users
know where to run the script, or at least later figure out why it
didn't work :)


 Functions that you can use in Irssi's Perl scripts
 --------------------------------------------------

If there's a "Xxxx::" text before the command, it means that it belongs to
that package. Like "Server::command" means that you should either call it as
  Irssi::Server::command($server, $cmd);
or more easily:
  $server->command($cmd);

Commands that don't have the Xxxx prefix are called as Irssi::command();

Information from most objects can be fetched with $object->{data}, for
example current nick in server could be read with $server->{nick}. List
of all the information that are in objects are in "Object->{}" sections
below.

Commands are split in two groups, generic ones that could be used with
any chat protocol, and IRC specific commands. If you want to use IRC
specific commands, or use IRC specific ->{data} in your scripts, you'll
need to add "use Irssi::Irc" to your scripts. IRC specific commands are
listed after the generic ones.


 *** General

Window active_win() - return active window
Server active_server() - return server in active window

windows() - return list of all windows
servers() - return list of all servers
reconnects() - return list of all server reconnections
channels() - return list of all channels
queries() - return list of all queries
commands() - return list of all commands
logs() - return list of all log files
ignores() - returns list of all ignores

Server::channels() - return list of channels in server
Server::queries() - return list of queries in server

print(str[, level])
Server::print(channel, str[, level])
Window::print(str[, level])
Windowitem::print(str[, level])
  Print `str'. Default level is MSGLEVEL_CLIENTNOTICE.

command(cmd)
Server::command(cmd)
Window::command(cmd)
Windowitem::command(cmd)
  Send a command `cmd' (in current channel). The '/' char isn't needed.


 *** Themes

You can have user configurable texts in scripts that work just like
irssi's internal texts that can be changed in themes.

First you'll have to register the formats:

Irssi::theme_register([
  'format_name', '{hilight my perl format!}',
  'format2', 'testing.. nick = $0, channel = $1'
]);

Printing happens with one of the functions:

printformat(level, format, ...)
Window::printformat(level, format, ...)
Server::printformat(target, level, format, ...)
Windowitem::printformat(level, format, ...)

For example:

  $channel->printformat(MSGLEVEL_CRAP, 'format2',
		        'nick', $channel->{name});


 *** Settings

settings_get_str(key)
settings_get_int(key)
settings_get_bool(key)
settings_get_time(key)
settings_get_level(key)
settings_get_size(key)
  Return value for setting.

settings_set_str(key, value)
settings_set_int(key, value)
settings_set_bool(key, value)
settings_set_time(key, value)
settings_set_level(key, value)
settings_set_size(key, value)
  Set value for setting.
  If you change the settings of another module/script with one of these, you
  must emit a "setup changed" signal afterwards.

settings_add_str(section, key, def)
settings_add_int(section, key, def)
settings_add_bool(section, key, def)
settings_add_time(section, key, def)
settings_add_level(section, key, def)
settings_add_size(section, key, def)
  Create new setting.

settings_remove(key)
  Remove a setting.


 *** Signals

signal_emit(signal, ...)
  Send signal `signal'. You can give 6 parameters at maximum.

signal_continue(...)
  Continue currently emitted signal with different parameters.

signal_add(signal, func)
  Bind `signal' to function `func'.

signal_add_first(signal, func)
  Bind `signal' to function `func'. Call `func' as soon as possible.

signal_add_last(signal, func)
  Bind `signal' to function `func'. Call `func' as late as possible.

signal_remove(signal, func)
  Unbind `signal' from function `func'.

signal_stop()
  Stop the signal that's currently being emitted.

signal_stop_by_name(signal)
  Stop the signal with name `signal' that's currently being emitted.

signal_register(hash)
  Register parameter types for one or more signals.
  `hash' must map one or more signal names to references to arrays
  containing 0 to 6 type names. Some recognized type names include
  int for integers, intptr for references to integers and string for
  strings. For all standard signals see src/perl/perl-signals-list.h
  in the source code (this is generated by src/perl/get-signals.pl).

  Any signals that were already registered are unaffected.

  Registration is required to get any parameters to signals written in
  Perl and to emit and continue signals from Perl.

  *** timeouts / IO listener / pidwait

timeout_add(msecs, func, data)
  Call `func' every `msecs' milliseconds (1000 = 1 second) with
  parameter `data'. Returns tag which can be used to stop the timeout.

timeout_add_once(msecs, func, data);
  Call `func' once after `msecs' milliseconds (1000 = 1 second)
  with parameter `data'. Returns tag which can be used to stop the timeout.

timeout_remove(tag)
  Remove timeout with tag.

input_add(source, condition, func, data)
  Call `func' with parameter `data' when specified IO happens.
  `source' is the file handle that is being listened. `condition' can
  be INPUT_READ, INPUT_WRITE or both. Returns tag which can be used to
  remove the listener.

input_remove(tag)
  Remove listener with tag.

pidwait_add(pid)
  Adds `pid' to the list of processes to wait for. The pid must identify
  a child process of the irssi process. When the process terminates, a
  "pidwait" signal will be sent with the pid and the status from
  waitpid(). This is useful to avoid zombies if your script forks.

pidwait_remove(pid)
  Removes `pid' from the list of processes to wait for. Terminated
  processes are removed automatically, so it is usually not necessary
  to call this function.

 *** Message levels

level2bits(level)
  Level string -> number

bits2level(bits)
  Level number -> string

combine_level(level, str)
  Combine level number to level string ("+level -level").
  Return new level number.


 *** Commands

Command->{}

  Bind command `cmd' to call function `func'. `category' is the
  category where the command is displayed in /HELP.

command_runsub(cmd, data, server, item)
  Run subcommands for `cmd'. First word in `data' is parsed as
  subcommand. `server' is Irssi::Server rec for current
  Irssi::Windowitem `item'.
  
  Call command_runsub in handler function for `cmd' and bind
  with command_bind("`cmd' `subcmd'", subcmdfunc[, category]);

command_unbind(cmd, func)
  Unbind command `cmd' from function `func'.

command_set_options(cmd, data)
  Set options for command `cmd' to `data'. `data' is a string of
  space separated words which specify the options. Each word can be
  optionally prefixed with one of the following character:

  '-': optional argument
  '+': argument required
  '@': optional numeric argument

command_parse_options(cmd, data)
  Parse options for command `cmd' in `data'. It returns a reference to
  an hash table with the options and a string with the remaining part
  of `data'. On error it returns the undefined value.

 *** Server redirections

This is a powerful feature of Irssi that I haven't seen in other IRC
clients. You can EASILY grab the server's reply for a command you send
to server without any horrible kludges.

redirect_register(command, remote, timeout, start, stop, opt)
   Register new redirection command. By default irssi has already
   registered at least: whois, whowas, who, list, ison, userhost, ping,
   "mode channel" (/MODE #channel), "mode b" (/MODE #channel b), "mode e"
   and "mode I".

   `command' specifies the name of the command to register, it doesn't
   have to be a real command name, but something you just specify to
   redirect_event() when using this redirection.

   `remote' specifies if the command is by default a remote command
   (eg. sent to another server). redirect_event() may override this.

   `timeout' - If remote is TRUE, specifies how many seconds to wait for
   reply before aborting.

   `start', `stop', `opt' - hash references with "event" => argpos entries.
   List of events that start and stop this redirection.
   Start event list may be empty, but there must be at least one
   stop event. Optional events are checked only if they are received
   immediately after one of the stop-events. `argpos' specifies the
   word number in event string which is compared to wanted argument,
   -1 = don't compare, TRUE always.

  Example (already done by irssi):

  Irssi::redirect_register('mode channel', 0, 0,
  	undef, # no start events
	{ # stop events
	  "event 324" => 1, # MODE-reply
	  "event 403" => 1, # no such channel
	  "event 442" => 1, # "you're not on that channel"
	  "event 479" => 1  # "Cannot join channel (illegal name)"
	}, { # optional events
	  "event 329", 1 # Channel create time
	} );

Server::redirect_event(command, count, arg, remote, failure_signal, signals)
   Specify that the next command sent to server will be redirected.
   NOTE: This command MUST be called before sending the command to server.

   `command' - Name of the registered redirection that we're using.

   `count' - How many times to execute the redirection. Some commands may
   send multiple stop events, like MODE #a,#b.

   `arg' - The argument to be compared in event strings. You can give multiple
   arguments separated with space.

   `remote' - Specifies if the command is a remote command, -1 = use default.

   `failure_signal' - If irssi can't find the stop signal for the redirection,
   this signal is called.

   `signals' - hash reference with "event" => "redir signal" entries.
   If the event is "", all the events belonging to the redirection but not
   specified here, will be sent there.

  Example:

  # ignore all events generated by whois query, except 311.
  $server->redirect_event("whois", 1, "cras", 0, undef, {
			  "event 311" => "redir whois",
			  "" => "event empty" });
  $server->send_raw("WHOIS :cras");

  Join to channels in server. `channels' may also contain keys for
  channels just like with /JOIN command. `automatic' specifies if this
  channel was joined "automatically" or if it was joined because join
