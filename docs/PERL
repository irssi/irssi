 Running Perl scripts
 --------------------

Place new scripts to ~/.irssi/scripts/, or /usr/lib/irssi/scripts/
directory and run then with /RUN script. Or you could also run the
script from another place by specifying the whole path to it.

Using /PERLFLUSH closes and reopens the perl interpreter removing all
Perl scripts from memory. There's currently no way to unload a single Perl
script. Also, Irssi doesn't check if you run the same script twice or
different scripts use signal_add() for the same named function - it will
probably crash or do some weird things then.


 Irssi's signals
 ---------------

Irssi is pretty much based on sending and handling different signals.
Like when you receive a message from server, say,
":nick!user@there.org PRIVMSG you :blahblah". Irssi will first send a
"server incoming" signal with the raw line as it's first parameter. You
probably don't want to use this signal. Next thing Irssi does is to
interpret the header and send a "server event" signal with arguments
"PRIVMSG you...", server, "nick", "user@there.org". You probably don't
want to use this either, since next irssi will send an "event privmsg"
signal with the "you :blahblah" as it's argument. You can at any point
grab the signal, do whatever you want to do with it and optionally stop
it from going any further by returning from the function with value 1. 

For example:

--------------------------------------------------------
sub event_privmsg {
	# $data = "nick/#channel :text"
	my ($data, $server, $nick, $address) = @_;
	my ($target, $text) = $data =~ /^(\S*)\s:(.*)/;

	return 1 if ($text =~ /free.*porn/);
	return 1 if ($nick =~ /idiot/);
}

Irssi::signal_add("event privmsg", "event_privmsg")
--------------------------------------------------------

This will hide all public or private messages that match the regexp
"free.*porn" or the sender's nick contain the word "idiot".

A list of signals that irssi send can be found from SIGNALS file.


 Message levels
 --------------

Several functions expect message levels. Sometimes numeric and sometimes
alphabetic. Yes, it's stupid, will fix it :) For now you can use 
Irssi::level2bits() function to convert the level string to numeric. Here's
all the levels that irssi supports currently:

CRAP, MSGS, PUBLIC, NOTICES, SNOTES, CTCPS, ACTIONS, JOINS, PARTS
QUITS, KICKS, MODES, SMODES, TOPICS, WALLOPS, INVITES, NICKS, PONGS
DCC, CLIENTNOTICE, CLIENTCRAP, CLIENTERROR, HILIGHT
(and NOHILIGHT if you don't want the message to be hilighted ever..)

For example:

$server->printtext("#channel", Irssi::level2bits('clientcrap'), 'Hello, world');

Writes text to #channel window with clientcrap level.


 Functions that you can use in Irssi's Perl scripts
 --------------------------------------------------

This is just my very first implementation and things will probably change.

Commands marked with (!!) mean that you shouldn't use it unless you
know what you're doing..

If there's a "Xxxx::" text before the command, it means that it belongs to
that package. Like "Server::command" means that you should either call it as
  Irssi::Server::command($server, $cmd);
or more easily:
  $server->command($cmd);

Commands that don't have the Xxxx prefix are called as Irssi::command();


 *** General

Channel cur_channel() - return current channel
Server cur_server() - return current server

channels() - return list of all channels
servers() - return list of all servers
commands() - return list of all commands
dccs() - return list of all dcc connections
logs() - return list of all log files
plugins() - return list of all plugins

print(str)
  Print `str' to current window as "Irssi notice".

command(cmd, [Server server, [Channel channel]])
  Send a command `cmd' (in current channel). This will work just as if you
  had typed `cmd' in command line, so you'll need to use /COMMANDS or the
  text will be sent to the channel.

Server::command(cmd, [Channel channel])
  Just like above, except different calling method.

Channel::command(cmd)
  Just like above, except different calling method.

Server::printtext(channel, level, str)
  Print `str'.


 *** Message levels

level2bits(level)
  Level string -> number

bits2level(bits)
  Level number -> string

combine_level(level, str)
  Combine level number to level string ("+level -level").
  Return new level number.


 *** Signals / timeouts

signal_emit(signal, ...)
  Send signal `signal'

signal_add(signal, func)
  Bind `signal' to function `func'

signal_remove(signal, func)
  Unbind `signal' from function `func'

tag timeout_add(msecs, func, data)
  Call `func' every `msecs' milliseconds (1000 = 1 second) with
  parameter `data'. Returns tag which can be used to stop the timeout.

timeout_remove(tag)
  Remove timeout with tag.


 *** Commands

Command::values()
  Get some information about command. This function returns a reference to
  hash table (FIXME: can't it return the hash table itself?!). Hash table
  has keys:
	"cmd" - Command
	"category" - Category

command_bind(cmd, category, func)
  Bind command `cmd' to call function `func'. `category' is the
  category where the command is displayed in /HELP.

command_unbind(cmd, func)
  Unbind command `cmd' from function 'func.

Server::command_split(cmd, arg, max_nicks)
  Split the `cmd' into several commands so `arg' argument has only
  `max_nicks' number of nicks.

  Example: $server->command_split("KICK nick1,nick2,nick3 :byebye", 1, 2);
  Irssi will send commands "KICK nick1,nick2 :byebye" and
  "KICK nick3 :byebye" to server.


 *** Server functions

Server::values()
  Get some information about server. This function returns a reference to
  hash table (FIXME: can't it return the hash table itself?!). Hash table
  has keys:
	"address" - Address where we connected (irc.blah.org)
	"real_address" - Who the server thinks it is (irc1.blah.org)
	"port" - Port where we connected
	"tag" - Unique server tag.
	"ircnet" - IRC network
	"password" - Password we used in connection.

	"nick" - Current nick
	"wanted_nick" - Nick which we would prefer to use
	"username" - User name
	"realname" - Real name
	"usermode" - Current user mode
	"usermode_away" - Are we marked as away? 1|0
	"away_reason" - Away reason
	"connected" - Is connection finished? 1|0
	"connection_lost" - Did we lose the connection (1) or was
	                    the connection meant to be disconnected (0)
  Example:
	%server_info = %{Irssi::cur_server->values()};
	Irssi::print("Current server = ".$server_info{'address'});

Server server_connect(address, [port=6667, [password='', [nick='', [channels='']]]])
  Create new server connection.

Server::disconnect()
  Disconnect from server.

Server server_find_tag(tag)
  Find server with tag

Server server_find_ircnet(ircnet)
  Find first server that is in `ircnet'

Channel channel_find_any(channel)
  Find `channel' from any server

Channel Server::channel_find_level(level)
  Find channel with level `level' preferably from specified server, but
  fallbacks to any channel the matching level.

Server::send_raw(cmd)
  Send raw message to server, it will be flood protected so you
  don't need to worry about it.

Server::ctcp_send_reply(data)
  Send CTCP reply. This will be "CTCP flood protected" so if there's too
  many CTCP requests in buffer, this reply might not get sent.


 *** Server redirections

WARNING: It's easy to mess up the Irssi's internal server expectations with
these commands!

This is a powerful feature of Irssi that I can't seen in other IRC clients.
You can EASILY grab the server's reply for a command you send to server
without any horrible kludges.

Server::redirect_init(command, last, ...)
  Initialize redirection for specified command. This needs to be done only
  once. Irssi already initializes commands "WHOIS", "WHO", "LIST" and "ISON".
  `command' is the whole name of the signal, like "command whois".
  `last' specifies how many of the items in `...' is considered as the
  "last event" from the command.

  Example: $server->redirection_init('command who',
        2, # 2 first events will finish the command
	'event 401', # unknown nick (finished)
	'event 315', # end of who (finished)
	'event 352'); # who line (wait..)

Server::redirect_event(arg, last, ...)
  Add redirection. `arg' is a space separated list of arguments that should
  match before Irssi will redirect the event (think of /WHOIS nick nick and
  doing another to different nick immediately after it, there's no way of
  knowing which will return first. so, arg would be in this case 'nick').

  `last' specifies how many of the following events are considered as
  "last event" from command - just like in redirect_init().

  `...' is `event, signal, argpos, ...`, where
  `event' is the event we're waiting from server.
  `signal' is the signal we will send after receiving the event. It should
           always start with 'redir ' so that Irssi's perl handler knows to
	   send correct arguments to signal handler.
  `argpos' is the argument position in event's data or -1 if it
           should be ignored.

  Example:
	$server->send_raw('WHOIS :cras');
	$server->redirect_event('cras', 2,
			  "event 318", "redir end_of_whois", -1,
			  "event 402", "redir no_such_server", -1,
			  "event 401", "redir no_such_nick", 1,
			  "event 311", "redir whois", 1,
			  "event 301", "redir whois_away", 1,
			  "event 312", "redir whois_server", 1,
			  "event 313", "redir whois_oper", 1,
			  "event 317", "redir whois_idle", 1,
			  "event 319", "redir whois_channels", 1);
  In the 402-case we tried "/WHOIS nick nick" but nick didn't exist..

group Server::redirect_single_event(arg, last, group, event, signal, argpos)
  Same as redirect_event() except you can set it up in pieces.
  If `group' is 0, it will create new group and return it's id.
