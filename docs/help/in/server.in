%9Description:%9

    Displays, adds, modifies or removes the network configuration of IRC
    servers.

    When using the ADD parameter on a server that already exists, the
    configuration will be merged with each other.

    When using the command without any of the given parameters, it will
    connect to the specified server; the server in the active window will be
    disconnected unless you prepend the server with the '+' character; the same
    method is applicable to the CONNECT parameter.
