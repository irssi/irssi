%9Description:%9

    Displays, adds, modifies or removes the network configuration of IRC
    networks.

    When using the ADD parameter on a network that already exists, the
    configuration will be merged with each other.

    We recommend using 'WAIT 2000' between the automated commands in order to
    prevent you from being kicked from the network due to flooding commands.
