WATCH %|[[+|-]<nick>][ [+|-]<nick> ...]

Works only in networks using Bahamut ircd.

WATCH is somewhat equal to ISON/NOTIFY, but server-based. With WATCH
server sends status information to client, instead of client sending
ISON's. Therefore WATCH is technically a bit smarter solution than
ISON/NOTIFY. The only disadvantage is your WATCH list not being
"saved". Once you disconnect, your WATCH list will get cleared.

WATCH is based on a nick, and must be prepended with a plus ('+') to be
added to your watch list. A minus sign ('-') will remove an entry from
the list. With no arguments, WATCH returns a list of your WATCH list
entries.
