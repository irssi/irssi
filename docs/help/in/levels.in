        CLIENTCRAP      Irssi's internal messages.
        CLIENTERROR     Irssi's internal error messages.
        CLIENTNOTICE    Irssi's internal notices.
        CRAP            Can be almost anything.
        CTCPS           CTCP messages.
        DCC             DCC protocol related messages.
        DCCMSGS         DCC chat messages.
        INVITES         An invite is received.
        JOINS           A nickname joins a channel.

        NOTICES         Notices sent from a nickname.
        PARTS           A nickname leaves a channel.
        PUBLIC          Public messages in a channel.
        QUITS           A nickname disconnects from IRC.
        SNOTES          Notices sent from a server.
        TOPICS          A channel topic is modified.
        WALLOPS         A wallop is received.

    These are the special levels you can use:

        HILIGHT         The text is highlighted.
        NEVER           Never ignores or logs the message.
        HIDDEN          Hides the message when window HIDELEVEL includes HIDDEN.
        NO_ACT          Doesn't trigger any activity in the statusbar.
        NOHILIGHT       The text is not highlighted.

    When using levels from Irssi scripts, you need to prepend the level with
    'MSGLEVEL_'; for example 'CRAP' becomes 'MSGLEVEL_CRAP'.
