%9Description:%9

    Opens a log file and stores the messages of the given targets into it; the
    log files will be locked so multiple clients cannot log to the same file.

    You may use any of the date formats to create a log rotation; we strongly
    recommend you to enable autolog if you are interested in keeping logs.

    /LOG OPEN -targets mike ~/irclogs/mike.log MSGS
