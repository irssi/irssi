@SYNTAX:trace@

Without a specified server TRACE shows the current connections on
the local server.  If you specify a remote server it will show
all servers between your current server and that remote server
as well as the connections on that remote server. With a nick it
shows the servers in between and information about that nick.

On some servers, TRACE shows information such as IP addresses
and idle times.
