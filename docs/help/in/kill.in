@SYNTAX:kill@

IRC operator command.

KILL is used to forcibly remote a client from the irc network. 
It works similarly to KICK, except that a reason must be 
given (even if it is meaningless or flat-out wrong). 

In general, KILL is useful only as a warning tool for abusive 
users. Modern irc clients (this one included) have automated 
means for reconnecting to a server after a disconnection (whether 
due to a KILL or something else), so KILL is by no means a 
permanent solution. It is not intended as a means for personal 
vendettas; this practice is generally frowned upon.
