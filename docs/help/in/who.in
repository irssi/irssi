@SYNTAX:who@

Without parameters, shows all users and their user infos
on the current channel. If you specify a channel, shows
all users on the given channel.

If you specify an string with wildcards, you will be
shown all users whose nick, userhost or realname matches
the wildcard expression.

If a channel is secret and you're not on it, you will not
get any output. Otherwise if you're not on it, you will be
shown only those channel members who do not have the
invisible (+i) mode set.

The flags field has the following meaning:
  H - The user is not away (here).
  G - The user is set away (gone).
  * - The user is an IRC operator.
  @ - The user is a channel op in the channel listed.
  + - The user is voiced in the channel listed.

Examples:
   /WHO          - Shows users on current channel
   /WHO #irssi   - Shows users on channel #irssi
   /WHO timo*    - Shows users whose nick, userhost,
                   or realname begins with string 'timo'
