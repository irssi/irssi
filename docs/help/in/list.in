@SYNTAX:list@

%9Parameters:%9

    -yes:    Confirms that you want to receive a large amount of data.

    If the exact name of a channel is given, the only information about this
    channel is requested; otherwise, a list of all channels will be displayed.

%9Description:%9

    Displays the channel names that match your request; requesting all channels
    may cause the server to disconnect you for flooding.

%9Examples:%9

    /LIST
    /LIST -yes
    /LIST #ubuntu
    /LIST #*ubuntu*,>1

%9Remarks:%9

    Not all networks support server-side filtering and may provide a network
    service instead; on IRCnet, you may use the ALIS service:

    /QUOTE SQUERY ALIS :HELP
    /MSG ALIS HELP
