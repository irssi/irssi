%9Parameters:%9

    -yes:    Confirms that you want to receive a large amount of data.

    If the exact name of a channel is given, then only information about this
    channel is requested. Otherwise, the list of all channels will be displayed.

%9Description:%9

    Requesting all channels may cause the server to disconnect you for flooding,
    so it is protected by -yes. Not all networks support server side filtering.
    Some may provide a service bot instead, try /quote squery alis :help or /msg alis help

%9Examples:%9

    /LIST -yes
    /LIST #ubuntu
    /LIST #*ubuntu*,>1
