Works only in some IRC networks (hybrid-like ircds).

KNOCK is a feature that lets you request access to a channel they cannot join without an invite, a key or a raised limit.

The following conditions must be met for KNOCK to work:

 - You are not banned from the channel
 - Channel is not private (+p)
 - You are not already on the channel
 - Channel is invite only (+i), has a key (+k) or limit is full

When successful KNOCK is issued, it sends a notice to channel operators. Use of KNOCK is rate limited by the server.
